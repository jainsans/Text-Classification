Regarding hardware, it's only the battery that I feel needs improvement.But the software was a huge step down. I mean since when did removing features started being called an upgrade? Some very cool features like the car locator widget in the OnePlus shelf, displaying time with seconds in the status bar, have been removed. The shelf has moved to the top right corner, the Google news feed on the left side of home screen cannot be disabled, and the camera doesn't support full screen video recording.

Good for entertainment.3) Ram is expandable (8+5).4) It has 80W fast charging, feels like very fast. Full charge within 10 to 15 min (mind-blowing).5) Side mounted slider button for activating sound profiles like silent,vibrate. (a must wanted feature)6) Design of the phone is excellent and looks very aesthetic, eye catching from the back.Finally here are cons:1) battery drains easily, it comes with 4500 mAh battery but doesn't feel like that but mildly last a day with normal use.For medium use with normal gaming requires charging about 2 to 3 times a day but doesn't feels bad due to fast charging. But even though battery life cycle reduces fast--So Gamers do go for 5000mAh + series--2) front camera is average as compared to rear one. It does the job, works good in day light and not good in dim lighting conditions.These are the cons i have to point out.My Overall experience is good with this phone cons can be compromised according to this price, specification and afterall this OnePlus badging.

No junkware - upgraded two devices (Vivo v15 pro and Mi A3). Vivo had tons of junk apps that took up real estate and spammed the heck out of user. Oneplus maintains same clean experience as base Android with some nice navigation features.5. Reliable software updates - my work access requires latest security patches - which are always on time.6.

But the real deal is this, on a price to performance basis I don't think Samsung can match OnePlus without cannibalizing its sales of phones which are selling at 50,000 Rs plus range, hence you see things like Samsung capping the Ram and Storage ( i.e deliberately cripple the phone to protect the premium phones). What I found with OnePlus is they go all out on each price point - i.e deliver the maximum which is possible at a particular price point without thinking about cannibalizing its premium range of phone. Also, my last phone which was hardly 3 years phone ( Samsung Galaxy Note 10) died due to water damage - this was supposed to be a IP68 phone, after this incident I don't think paying a premium for Samsung which unlike Apple does not last more than 3 years. If I were to spend 50k plus on a phone I would rather buy an Apple which reliability wise is like the Toyota of the phone world ( my wife's Iphone 6s has lasted 8 years !!).

But this new phone (Nord 2T) which is running a latest version of Android 12, doesn't work.  And that's a big turn off for me and I have initiated a return today - hope I get a replacement as the technician appointment is fixed 7 days from now.But if anyone is looking for a smooth device, please don't buy this phone.  In today's times, it is definitely not accepted if a basic feature like Android Auto doesn't work.[EDITED on 15 Oct 2022]: Raised a replacement request - it's not automatic. They called me to say that they will fix an appointment with Oneplus technician after a week (19th) however, the someone from their Bangalore center called up on 13th. Asked me the usual things - like is the software updated, etc. Suggested a reset which I had done the previous night itself. So he asked me to take it to the nearest authorized service center. Took it to Gurgaon service center, demonstrated the problem. They even connected another same model phone from their inventory - didn't work. Conencted a Oneplus 9 and it worked without issues. Took all the debug logs and told me that the they will share with the Bangalore team for fix.In the meantime, one of my friend suggested to change cables. I had already tried with 3 Oneplus cables and one Xiaomi cable - they didn't work. But this time, I tried with a simple cable that I had bought in the local market for some other device. When I connected this cable, bang... it worked! So, in a way, my problem is solved but Oneplus and Google AA team will have to work together to give the customers a seamless way for their products to work.[Edited on 24 Oct ]: Even with the 3rd party cable, it stopped working. :(\",\n",

I am not a gamer and don't play any games but I use multiple apps. I find the phone to be handling very smoothly. I heating issue is solved with the latest update.Some pros and cons are as under ( comparing this phone with my previous phone OnePlus 6T)Pros- Great build quality feels premium, Great speakers, 6+ hrs battery back up, OnePlus user experience, extended 1 yr warranty at only additional Rs 700, Quick charging, smooth experience.Cons- Average Camera, Phone receiver speaker was initially not clear, however I have find it to improve.If you are shifting from any flagship phone to this you will find the device to be very average however this is a best option to upgrade from budget smartphone/first smartphone.Lastly it cannot be compared with nothing phone. It comes in very different price segment. Nothing phone with charger will cost you around 40k, so pointless to compare my view.It's a very safe phone to purchase no compromise however no surprises also. Go for it. My rating 4.2/5.\",\n",

In fact OnePlus had the dark theme way before Android offically launched it for the Google pixel.Had this been some other xyz brand, I'd have been blown away, but since this is a OnePlus, I expected a lot more. Regarding hardware, it's only the battery that I feel needs improvement.But the software was a huge step down. I mean since when did removing features started being called an upgrade? Some very cool features like the car locator widget in the OnePlus shelf, displaying time with seconds in the status bar, have been removed. The shelf has moved to the top right corner, the Google news feed on the left side of home screen cannot be disabled, and the camera doesn't support full screen video recording. Moreover, one of the most significant feature introduced in Android 10, the free form popup window has been removed as well. The Oxygen OS 12 update is more of a downgrade than an upgrade.\",\n",

Let's talk about the pros first.1) Rear Camera is best with Sony Flagship sensor, OIS is working pretty good.2) Dual speaker top front firing and bottom  Speaker is loud and crisp. Good for entertainment.3) Ram is expandable (8+5).4) It has 80W fast charging, feels like very fast. Full charge within 10 to 15 min (mind-blowing).5) Side mounted slider button for activating sound profiles like silent,vibrate. (a must wanted feature)6) Design of the phone is excellent and looks very aesthetic, eye catching from the back.Finally here are cons:1) battery drains easily, it comes with 4500 mAh battery but doesn't feel like that but mildly last a day with normal use.For medium use with normal gaming requires charging about 2 to 3 times a day but doesn't feels bad due to fast charging. But even though battery life cycle reduces fast--So Gamers do go for 5000mAh + series--2) front camera is average as compared to rear one. It does the job, works good in day light and not good in dim lighting conditions.These are the cons i have to point out.My Overall experience is good with this phone cons can be compromised according to this price, specification and afterall this OnePlus badging. It's an experienceGo for it.\",\n",

But the real deal is this, on a price to performance basis I don't think Samsung can match OnePlus without cannibalizing its sales of phones which are selling at 50,000 Rs plus range, hence you see things like Samsung capping the Ram and Storage ( i.e deliberately cripple the phone to protect the premium phones). What I found with OnePlus is they go all out on each price point - i.e deliver the maximum which is possible at a particular price point without thinking about cannibalizing its premium range of phone. Also, my last phone which was hardly 3 years phone ( Samsung Galaxy Note 10) died due to water damage - this was supposed to be a IP68 phone, after this incident I don't think paying a premium for Samsung which unlike Apple does not last more than 3 years. If I were to spend 50k plus on a phone I would rather buy an Apple which reliability wise is like the Toyota of the phone world ( my wife's Iphone 6s has lasted 8 years !!).

But this new phone (Nord 2T) which is running a latest version of Android 12, doesn't work.  And that's a big turn off for me and I have initiated a return today - hope I get a replacement as the technician appointment is fixed 7 days from now.But if anyone is looking for a smooth device, please don't buy this phone.  In today's times, it is definitely not accepted if a basic feature like Android Auto doesn't work.[EDITED on 15 Oct 2022]: Raised a replacement request - it's not automatic. They called me to say that they will fix an appointment with Oneplus technician after a week (19th) however, the someone from their Bangalore center called up on 13th. Asked me the usual things - like is the software updated, etc. Suggested a reset which I had done the previous night itself. So he asked me to take it to the nearest authorized service center. Took it to Gurgaon service center, demonstrated the problem. They even connected another same model phone from their inventory - didn't work. Conencted a Oneplus 9 and it worked without issues. Took all the debug logs and told me that the they will share with the Bangalore team for fix.In the meantime, one of my friend suggested to change cables. I had already tried with 3 Oneplus cables and one Xiaomi cable - they didn't work. But this time, I tried with a simple cable that I had bought in the local market for some other device. When I connected this cable, bang... it worked! So, in a way, my problem is solved but Oneplus and Google AA team will have to work together to give the customers a seamless way for their products to work.[Edited on 24 Oct ]: Even with the 3rd party cable, it stopped working. :(\",\n",

The phone charges from zero to 100 in about 35-40 minutes.- Overall, a great purchase in this budget, I believe the One Plus Nord 2T to be the best  smartphone in this price range.Cons :- The battery drains out very quickly.- The phone heats up a bit when using constantly for some time.- The Camera is not really great as I expected it to be, the AI camera mode makes the images blurry and over processed, due to some noise reduction algorithm.- The camera module in the back looks very pooly designed. The are three cameras, but the way it's designed it almost looks like there's 4 cameras.

I heating issue is solved with the latest update.Some pros and cons are as under ( comparing this phone with my previous phone OnePlus 6T)Pros- Great build quality feels premium, Great speakers, 6+ hrs battery back up, OnePlus user experience, extended 1 yr warranty at only additional Rs 700, Quick charging, smooth experience.Cons- Average Camera, Phone receiver speaker was initially not clear, however I have find it to improve.If you are shifting from any flagship phone to this you will find the device to be very average however this is a best option to upgrade from budget smartphone/first smartphone.Lastly it cannot be compared with nothing phone. It comes in very different price segment. Nothing phone with charger will cost you around 40k, so pointless to compare my view.It's a very safe phone to purchase no compromise however no surprises also. Go for it. My rating 4.2/5.\",\n",

Battery drains very fast 35% reduced in 1.5 hours without video playback without any major works.2. Camera is not great. Realme 6 works better than this.3. UI is very very bad how people's likes oxygen ui I did not understand it's very slow and hangs a lot. Even I disabled all back ground operations including emergency wireless alers, find my phone etc still really bad.4. Phone getting heat easily just for phone calls as well its reaching 39 easily. Why this much heat. I used iqoo there in normal use 29 is temperature.5. Paid 29000 for this scarpI raised issue with Amazon. Amazon is helpless they got their commission so why they will bother.
